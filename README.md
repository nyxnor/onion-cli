# ONION-CLI

An easy to use Tor Hidden Service (Onion Services) manager.

The goal is to manage services on the the tor configuration level, not the web server level. Also need to be as portable as possible, so the variables for paths are only container inside onion.lib.

If you want extra functionalities to be a relay, bridge or connect to a bridge easily, you should check out [Torbox](https://github.com/radio24/TorBox).

Stage is constant development, unfinished. Backup mode is not complete, do not trust this repo yet.
