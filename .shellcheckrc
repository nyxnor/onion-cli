disable=SC2236  # (-n instead of ! -z): does not consider the var is not an integer
disable=SC1090  # (can't follow source): source is relative
disable=SC2086  # (double quote vars): some variables need to expand, remove this for verification
disable=SC2034  # (unused vars): only for the lib because the variables are not used there
